# Telecom Churn Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for a telecom company. The goal of the project is to identify which customers are likely to leave the service based on various behavioral and demographic factors. By analyzing these patterns, the company can take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce churn.

## Project Structure

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves understanding the data, visualizing important trends, and identifying patterns that impact customer churn. This analysis helps uncover insights about customer behavior and factors contributing to churn. You can find the complete EDA process in the Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook.

* Data Training and Model Development
The data training process includes feature engineering, applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and training a Random Forest model to predict churn. The training and model evaluation are detailed in the Data_Training.ipynb notebook.

## How to Use This Repository

* Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb: Contains the full exploratory data analysis.
* Data_Training.ipynb: Covers the data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Future Work

Further improvements, such as hyperparameter tuning with grid search and exploring more advanced models, will be implemented in future iterations of this project.

## Installation
